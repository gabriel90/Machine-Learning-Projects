    "# Predicting The Recurrence of Thyroid Cancer Using Machine Mearning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use machine learning to classify a patient as either having a recurrence of thyroid cancer or not. This \n",
    "will be what is called binary classification. For this project the predicted classes will just be a \"yes\" or \"no\" for the \n",
    "recurrence of thyroid cancer in the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is classification?\n",
    "Binary classification means that there is only two classes for the target variable on which we will make predictions on. There is also multiclass classification. \n",
    "Multiclass classification is when there are more than two classes that we are trying to predict. "

    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "In our case, the problem we will be exploring is **binary classification** (a sample can only be one of two things). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because we're going to be using a number of differnet **features** (pieces of information) about a person to predict whether they have thyroid cancer or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement,\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have thyroid cancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from the [Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/915/differentiated+thyroid+cancer+recurrence) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Howevever, we've downloaded it in a formatted way from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/thyroid-disease-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 16 attributes (features). **Attributes** (also called **features**) are the variables what we'll use to predict our **target variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes and features are also referred to as **independent variables** and a target variable can be referred to as a **dependent variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We use the independent variables to predict our dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in our case, the independent variables are a patients different medical attributes and the dependent variable is whether or not they have thyroid cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric is something you might define at the start of a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since machine learning is very experimental, you might say something like, \n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart thyroid cancer during the proof of concept, we'll pursure this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this is helpful is it provides a rough goal for a machine learning engineer or data scientist to work towards.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the nature of experimentation, the evaluation metric may change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",

    "### Thyroid Cancer Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Age: The age of the patient, as an integer, at the time of diagnosis or treatment, in years.\n",

    "    * 1: M = Male\n",
    "3. Smoking: Whether the patient is a smoker or not.\n",
    "    * 0: Yes = Smoker\n",
    "    * 1: No = Non-Smoker\n",
    "4. Hx Smoking: Smoking history of the patient (e.g., whether they have ever smoked).\n",
    "    * 0: Yes = History of smoking\n",
    "    * 1: No = No history of smoking\n",
    "5. Hx Radiotherapy: History of radiotherapy treatment for any condition.\n",
    "    * 0: Yes = History of radiotherapy\n",
    "    * 1: No = No history of radiotherapy\n",
    "6. Thyroid Function: The status of thyroid function, possibly indicating if there are any abnormalities.\n",
    "7. Physical Examination: Findings from a physical examination of the patient, which may include palpation of the thyroid gland and surrounding structures.\n",
    "8. Adenopathy: Presence or absence of enlarged lymph nodes (adenopathy) in the neck region.\n",
    "9. Pathology: Specific types of thyroid cancer as determined by pathology examination of biopsy samples.\n",
    "10. Focality: Whether the cancer is unifocal (limited to one location) or multifocal (present in multiple locations).\n",
    "11. Risk: The risk category of the cancer based on various factors, such as tumor size, extent of spread, and histological type.\n",
    "12. T: Tumor classification based on its size and extent of invasion into nearby structures.\n",
    "13. N: Nodal classification indicating the involvement of lymph nodes.\n",
    "14. M: Metastasis classification indicating the presence or absence of distant metastases.\n",
    "15. Stage: The overall stage of the cancer, typically determined by combining T, N, and M classifications.\n",
    "16. Response: Response to treatment, indicating whether the cancer responded positively, negatively, or remained stable after treatment.\n",
    "17. Recurred: Indicates whether the cancer has recurred after initial treatment."

    "A voting classifier first takes in a list of estimators and then trains them on the training set. When the training of all the classifiers is done \n",
    "you can then use the voting classifier to make predictions on new data. It works by either using hard voting or soft voting. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hard voting (a.k.a majority voting), means that the classifier wil predict the class that has been predicted the most by all the classifiers.\n",

    "The image below give an illustartion of the proccess (credit to the book \"Hands on Machine Learning\"). We will just use hard \n",
